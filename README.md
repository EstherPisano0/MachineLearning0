Regression

Set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the outcome or response variable, or a label in machine learning parlance) and one or more error-free independent variables (often called regressors, predictors, covariates, explanatory variables or features).

Regression analysis is widely used in various industries to understand the relationships between variables and make informed decisions. In finance, regression analysis helps investment managers value assets and understand how factors like commodity prices and market risks influence stock returns.

Regression analysis plays a crucial role in statistical modeling by estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used for prediction and forecasting, and can also be used to infer causal relationships between variables, although careful justification is needed for these interpretations.
